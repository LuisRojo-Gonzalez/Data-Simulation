# Data Simulation

In this repository, we perform a data simulation process such that

1. Given an univariate data
2. Found a suitable distribution that represents the data
3. Generate synthetical data a.k.a. simulated data

this process is quite useful when data is scarse (often the case) and not enough to apply algorithms that needs big amount of data.

Thus, we present an approach for discrete data simulation.
